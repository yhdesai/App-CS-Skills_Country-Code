## Unit 1 Lesson 2

As an example activity using HashMaps, create a program (not necessarily an Android app - command-line is fine) that will take in a three-letter country code (see ISO-3166) and will return the full name of the country to which it belongs. For example:

Input | Output
----- | ----------------------------------------------------
 GBR  | United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
 IDN  | Indonesia
 IND  | India
 
As an extension, if the input is greater than 3 letters, consider it as the name of a country, and return the three-letter code for it. Write a helpful error message if the input is neither a valid code nor a country name.
